## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Rajan Nishad<br/>
A passionate and curious Data Science student diving deep into the world of data, algorithms, and storytelling through insights.<br/>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my foundation in Python, machine learning, and data analysis â€” recently explored projects on real-world datasets (like COVID trends & housing prices).<br/>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and diving into ML algorithms â€” also brushing up on statistics and SQL to think more like a data scientist.<br/>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world data projects, hackathons, or research work where I can contribute and grow.<br/>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data cleaning struggles, Python tips, or how to stay motivated as a beginner â€” Iâ€™ve been there ðŸ˜…
